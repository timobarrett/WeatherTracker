# WeatherTracker
**Summary**

Weatherracker works with androids GPS service to collect weather data from the weather station closest to 
where the user is located.  Data is collected everyday at a fixed time.  Collection is rescheduled when the
device is rebooted.  Database will contain 1 weather record per day of the year and as many location records
as the user happens to be in when the weather is collected.

User interface is calendar based.  If weather data was collected for a day, clicking on the day will display the 
weather data.

**Next Step**

Roll up the data to a central server.  This will provide the means to track weather month/day/year over month/day/year.
Hope is that fix daily collection will help identify weather trends and changes.
