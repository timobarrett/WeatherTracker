         * If you don't have precise time requirements, use an inexact repeating alarm
         * the minimize the drain on the device battery.
         *
         * The call below specifies the alarm type, the trigger time, the interval at
         * which the alarm is fired, and the alarm's associated PendingIntent.
         * It uses the alarm type RTC_WAKEUP ("Real Time Clock" wake up), which wakes up
         * the device and triggers the alarm according to the time of the device's clock.
         *
         * Alternatively, you can use the alarm type ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP to trigger
         * an alarm based on how much time has elapsed since the device was booted. This
         * is the preferred choice if your alarm is based on elapsed time--for example, if
         * you simply want your alarm to fire every 60 minutes. You only need to use
         * RTC_WAKEUP if you want your alarm to fire at a particular date/time. Remember
         * that clock-based time may not translate well to other locales, and that your
         * app's behavior could be affected by the user changing the device's time setting.
         *
         * Here are some examples of ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP:
         *
         * // Wake up the device to fire a one-time alarm in one minute.
         * alarmMgr.set(AlarmManager.ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP,
         *         SystemClock.elapsedRealtime() +
         *         60*1000, alarmIntent);
         *
         * // Wake up the device to fire the alarm in 30 minutes, and every 30 minutes
         * // after that.
         * alarmMgr.setInexactRepeating(AlarmManager.ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP,
         *         AlarmManager.INTERVAL_HALF_HOUR,
         *         AlarmManager.INTERVAL_HALF_HOUR, alarmIntent);
         */

        // Set the alarm to fire at approximately 8:30 a.m., according to the device's
        // clock, and to repeat once a day.
